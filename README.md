Dynamic Programming Exercises
This repository contains several classical problems solved using dynamic programming in both top-down (recursive with memoization) and bottom-up (iterative/tabulation) approaches. Each solution measures and compares execution time.

1. Fibonacci Numbers
Input: Integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 90)

Approach: Top-down with memoization and bottom-up iteration.

Comparison: Recursive is cleaner, but iterative is generally faster for large n.

2. Factorial Calculation
Input: Integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 20)

Approach: Recursive with memoization and iterative loop.

Comparison: Both approaches perform similarly at this scale.

3. Climbing Stairs
Input: Integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 45)

Goal: Count the number of distinct ways to climb stairs (1 or 2 steps at a time).

Approach: Top-down and bottom-up.

Comparison: Iterative is faster and uses less memory.

4. Grid Unique Paths
Input: Integers m, n (1 ≤ m, n ≤ 100)

Goal: Count the number of unique paths in an m x n grid from top-left to bottom-right, moving only right or down.

Approach: Bottom-up 2D dynamic programming.

Comparison: Scales well even for large grids.
