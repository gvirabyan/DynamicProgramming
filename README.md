# Dynamic Programming Solutions

## 1. Fibonacci Number

### Description
Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

### Approaches
- Top-down recursion with memoization
- Bottom-up tabulation

### Performance
Measured and compared execution times.

## 2. Factorial Calculation

### Description
Calculate n! (factorial of n).

### Approaches
- Recursive with memoization
- Iterative loop

### Performance
Measured execution times for both.

## 3. Climbing Stairs Problem

### Description
Count the number of ways to climb a staircase of n steps (1 or 2 steps at a time).

### Approaches
- Top-down dynamic programming
- Bottom-up dynamic programming

### Performance
Execution time compared.

## 4. Unique Paths in Grid

### Description
Given an m Ã— n grid, count the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, moving only right or down.

### Approach
Bottom-up dynamic programming using a 2D array.

### Performance
Execution time measured.

## How to Run

Compile each program with a C++17 compatible compiler and run from the terminal. Inputs are taken from standard input.
